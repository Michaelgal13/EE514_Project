The following is a short description of all the files in the folder:

- term_project_script --- main MATLAB script used to simulate the motomatic pendulum system in closed loop.
                          This code also implements LQR for the system.

- findKp.m    ----------- matlab script used to find the potentiometer gain

- motomatic_pend.slx  --  Simulink file that simulates the closed loop response for the motomatic pendulum system.

- motomatic_pend_OL.slx - Simulink file that simualtes the open loop response for the motomatic system (wo the pendulum)

- OLtesting.mlx --------- MATLAB script used to test the motomatic in open loop (wo the pendulum)

- pend.gif -------------- animation of pendulum
